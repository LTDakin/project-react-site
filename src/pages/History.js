                        description="JavaScript, originally named Mocha, was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape
                        Communications. In response to Microsoftâ€™s Internet Explorer project, the platform Netscape
                        partnered with the creators of Java at Sun Microsystems. Following the hype of Java, they
                        decided to propose Mocha as a companion language to Java, changing the name to Javascript as
                        a marketing ploy to gain acceptance. Its marketing was short-lived in response to its
                        performance, and it became considered as UI glue by Java developers. However, JS acting as
                        glue is what the internet needed to flourish. JavaScript allowed programmers to react to events
                        and construct interactive components, which made it rise in popularity to become known as the
                        lingua franca (common language) of the web."

                        JavaScript was written in only 10 days and was heavily influenced by
                        the following languages: Self, Scheme, Java and C. JS is part of the three main components of
                        the World Wide Web, the other two being HTML and CSS. It is supported by all modern Web
                        browsers that have built-in interpreters. Despite the similarities between JavaScript and Java,
                        such as their name, standard libraries and syntax, they have significant differences. For example,
                        Java is compiled into bytecode and Javascript can be interpreted by a browser.
